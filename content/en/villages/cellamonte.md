## Introduction

The village of Cella Monte lies nestled in the rolling hills of the Monferrato Casalese.

Apparently the name derives from the wine cells that were dug into the sandstone in ancient times and occupied the vast area where the first dwellings were built. According to an another hypothesis instead it is to be attributed to the small monasteries called Celle. The name of Cella appears in documents such as a charter by Emperor Arrigo V (1116), later mentioned in a concession to Guglielmo Marquis of Monferrato by Emperor Frederick I (1164), in a public charter issued by Emperor Frederick II and in a document by Emperor Charles IV (1355) confirming the superiority of the 'Monferrini marchesi over Cella'. 

The entire Monferrato region and the Cella Monte area in particular is characterised by the copious presence of the so-called Pietra da Cantoni, a Miocene building stone, formed by limestone and marly marine layers that have been dated to the Burdigalian-Langhiano (20 to 14 million years ago) on the basis of the microfossils they contain.

## Points of interest

1. **The historic centre**: Cella Monte is a medieval village with narrow, picturesque streets that still retains its ancient charm. The stone houses, craft workshops and quiet atmosphere make it a fascinating place to visit.

2. **The parish church of Saints Quirico and Giulietta**: situated atop a lush green hill, it boasts an impressive façade, a true architectural jewel which opens with a portal adorned by a stone arch surmounted by a lunette.

3. **Palazzo Volta**: originally a parish house, it now houses the **Ecomuseo della Pietra da Cantoni**,  an enchanting place where history and art come together in a perfect harmony. 

6. **The "Infernòt"**: small chambers dug into the 'Pietra da Cantoni' with no lighting or ventilation, a typical feature of the Monferrato area.
These underground spaces, usually accessible through a cellar, are ideal places for storing bottled wine due to the constant temperature and humidity conditions.

During the festival you can taste truffle dishes and participate in excursions to search for and collect this mushroom.

2. **Le colline sono in Fiore (The Hills are in Bloom)**:  in May, this fascinating spring event comes to life, an opportunity for visitors to admire the beauty of these floral decorations along the town's central street. An original competition between residents where every year the inspiring theme is renewed, always offering new surprises and emotions. For those who particularly appreciate roses, a map will be available to guide them to discover the most precious specimens, planted in the most evocative places in the village. 

3. **Jazz:Re:Found Festival**: in September, this evocative musical event comes to life from the fusion of black music (especially jazz) with modern electronic music. It stands as a bridge between historical tradition and the future, combining the vintage charm of jazz festivals with the innovative advances of contemporary clubs. Jazz:Re:Found represents the union of different musical languages, narratives and heterogeneous audiences, resulting in an explosion of sounds, emotions and melodic echoes.

## Curiosity

Sometimes, while walking through the streets of Cella Monte, we stumble upon an incredible discovery: a shell embedded in a wall. This simple artefact takes us back in time, millions of years ago, when this land was submerged by the sea and the hills of Monferrato were fascinating archipelagos. Today, that maritime sandstone shell remains as a tangible sign of the extraordinary evolution that has transformed our planet.
