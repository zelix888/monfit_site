## Introduction

The village of Sala Monferrato is located on a high hill in the heart of Basso Monferrato.

The name of the village, which is probably of Lombard origin, seems to derive from the presence in the Middle Ages of a place dedicated to the storage of provisions, a sort of warehouse called "sala", located in the village itself.

This typical village developed over the centuries around a castle that was originally used for defence.

Today you can still see the large entrance gate to the fortified area, which was defended by a fortress that has been transformed over time into an elegant neo-Gothic palace.

## Points of interest

1. **Castle of Sala Monferrato**: an old medieval brick castle in the centre of the village with well-preserved towers and walls.

2. **Church of San Francesco**: located at the upper end of the village, above the castle, it is a religious building from the 15th century that was built as the seat of the brotherhood of penitents and was initially dedicated to St Anthony of Padua and later to St Francis. The façade has a triangular gable and a high bell tower next to the apse.

3. **Church of San Giacomo**: located in the centre of the village under the ancient walls that correspond to the old village, it is the main church of Sala Monferrato. 
It was built from 1582 onwards to a design by the architect Domenico Scovazino, enlarged in the 18th century and rebuilt in the early 19th century. Inside there are three works by Guglielmo Caccia, known as Moncalvo.

4. **Church of San Grato**: the church was built in the second half of the 17th century not far from the village, probably as thanksgiving after an epidemic, and has a façade of exposed brick with an octagonal tiburium and a curved gable. It was restored in the middle of the 18th century by Giovanni Battista Scapitta.

5. **Casa Ricordi**: opened on 28 October 2017 with the presence of artists such as Paolo Conte, Gino Paoli and Ivan Cattaneo, it is the only museum in the world dedicated to Nanni Ricordi, considered the inventor of singer-songwriters. 
Located above the post office in the main street of the village, it houses posters, autographed album covers, letters from celebrities such as Maria Callas and Miranda Martino, opera librettos and many other testimonies of the musicians promoted by Nanni.

6. **Big bench no. 48 "Rosso Barbera"**: not far from the church of San Grato is the big bench no. 48 with a panoramic view of the hills and the village of Sala Monferrato.
