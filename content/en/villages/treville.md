## Introduction

The village of Treville, nicknamed 'the balcony over the Alps', is located in the Lower Monferrato on the border with the province of Asti.

The name Treville (from the Latin 'three country houses') first appeared in an ancient document dating back to 1202, where Marquis Bonifacio I Aleramo conferred the feud on the nobleman Anselmo Musso di Paciliano. The local statutes, dated 1303, are among the oldest in Monferrato.

During the period of Mantuan rule, Treville passed from hand to hand, from the Gonzaga to Giulio Strozzi in 1590 and then to Gerolamo Amarotto de' Andreasi in 1602. In 1699, the feud was acquired by Giacomo Bartolomeo Gozani, whose illustrious family commissioned the construction of Palazzo Treville in Casale Monferrato. From 1713, Treville came under the control of the Savoys and followed the vicissitudes of the Savoy royal family.

## Points of interest

1. **Parish church of Sant'Ambrogio**: consecrated in 1782, it is one of the oldest churches in the area. Its construction was financed by the local community and the project was entrusted to the architect Evasio Andrea De Gioanni. It houses valuable works of art, including paintings and religious sculptures. The imposing profile of the church overlooks a wonderful balcony from which, on clear days, the magnificence of the Alpine Arch can be admired.

2. **Church of San Quirico**: located among the vineyards to the north of the old town, it is a medieval example still present in the area. Built in the 12th century, it was the religious landmark of the now vanished village of Arliate. Of great interest are the graffiti left by medieval pilgrims both inside and outside the parish church.

3. **Devasini Municipal House**: it represents the cultural hub of Treville. Purchased and restored 18 years ago by the Municipality, this imposing building houses the Municipal Library, which organises events for young people, the Civic Collection of the works of Mario Surbone and two rooms used for conferences and concerts held by Luca Solerio. In the spacious cellar you can admire an ancient wine press, an ice house and an infernot, all carved out of the Pietra da Cantoni.
