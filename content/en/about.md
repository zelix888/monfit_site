Hi, this is Marco Aiolo,
creator of this blog dedicated to finding new routes in the Monferrato area.

<p class="text-center"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1603415526960-f7e0328c63b1?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1170&q=80" class="img-fluid w-50 rounded"/></p>

This idea stems from my deep desire to enhance this place by introducing you to picturesque medieval villages and letting you admire enchanting landscapes while sitting on big benches scattered around the area.

On my blog you will find a series of articles on the most striking paths you can easily download on your smartphone, with detailed descriptions of the difficulty levels, distances, and points of interest along the way.

Monfit is not just a blog, it is an invitation to rediscover the pleasure of walking, an opportunity to slow down the hectic pace of life, to connect with nature and, last but not least, to fully enjoy the surrounding beauty that we often fail to appreciate.

So, let’s meet on social media to share information, useful tips, facts and much more about this territory.

I’m looking forward to it and enjoy your walks!
